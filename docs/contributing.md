# Contributing to OpenBazaar

Anyone is free to contribute to OpenBazaar. The process and guidelines for contributing are similar to those for [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Many of the OpenBazaar core developers (including the lead maintainer) are currently hired by OB1 but over time as the OpenBazaar ecosystem grows, there will hopefully be many more contributors affiliated with other organizations or independent.

To make a contribution to any of the OpenBazaar GitHub repositories, you should fork the repository, create a topic branch and then submit a pull request when you have completed your work. 

To ensure the highest probability of your pull request being merged, it is best to discuss what you intend to contribute with core developers/other contributors on the OpenBazaar [Slack](http://slack.openbazaar.org)

If you would like to add a new feature rather than just a bug fix, you may need to follow the OBIP (OpenBazaar Improvement Proposal). More information on the OBIP process can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/obips).

The OpenBazaar client is coded in Javascript. The server is coded in Go. If you code in the above languages, we encourage you to contribute!
