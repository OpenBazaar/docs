# Core Values

OpenBazaar is a protocol and network for trade. It is a neutral technology that can be used for many types of transactions. If it succeeds it will evolve into a global online marketplace where goods, services and financial contracts are traded freely without requiring a third party intermediary. The OpenBazaar community (users, developers, applications etc) will ultimately determine what that marketplace looks like.

The protocol is designed to be censorship resistant and to offer privacy to its users when they require it. No one (including the OpenBazaar core developers) can control what is listed. If you would prefer to not see listings that may be illegal in your jurisdiction, there are multiple businesses providing curated experiences.

A long term goal of OpenBazaar is to be cryptocurrency and blockchain agnostic. Limited resources and user experience considerations will restrict progress on this front in the short term. 

The project is guided by the processes of other successful open source projects (Bitcoin, Linux etc). If you would like features to be added to the protocol, it is possible to submit [OBIPs](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/obips) (OpenBazaar Improvement Plans) after discussing them with the OpenBazaar core developers.
