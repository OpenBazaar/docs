# FAQ

Can you switch between accounts on the same machine?

You can switch between two accounts. An account is basically a server, so you would need to run multiple servers. If you are using the bundled app, that already comes with a server, so for your second server, you can download the standalone server and run that on different ports and from a different data directory. Then in the client you just make a separate server configuration for the second server and toggling between the two can be done with one click.
