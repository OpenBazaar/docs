# Altcoins

The early release of OpenBazaar 2.0 will only accept the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. There is a Shapeshift integration so you can still purchase items on OpenBazaar with other cryptocurrencies via Shapeshift. There are plans to facilitate direct purchases with other cryptocurrencies in the near future.

The activation of SegWit in Bitcoin Core should decrease transaction fees in the short term but there are multiple cryptocurrencies that can offer additional or superior features such as lower transaction fees, shorter block times or stronger privacy.

In theory, the OpenBazaar protocol could work with any cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin. In practice, there are certain features a cryptocurrency must have to be added seamlessly to the OpenBazaar protocol. Multi-signature transactions must be enabled and a UTXO model is preferential to the account model. In summary, cryptocurrencies that are a close derivative to Bitcoin are stronger candidates for integrations in the short term.
