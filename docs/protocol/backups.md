## Backing up your Bitcoin wallet

Your Bitcoin wallet is generated using a 12 word seed which you are encouraged to save on paper. (The order of the words is important.) This seed will allow you to access your funds in the case of a loss or failure of your machine

There is an outstanding pull request to allow you to access your seed in the user interface.
