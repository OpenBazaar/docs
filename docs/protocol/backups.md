# Backups

## Backing up your Bitcoin wallet

Your Bitcoin wallet is generated using a 12 word seed which you are encouraged to save on paper. (The order of the words is important.) This seed will allow you to access your funds in the case of a loss or failure of your machine.

You can find your Bitcoin seed in mainnet.db which is located at ~/.openbazaar2.0/datastore/mainnet.db on Linux or ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenBazaar2.0/datastore/mainnet.db on Mac OSX.  

There is an outstanding pull request to allow you to access your seed in the user interface.

## Backing up your store and other account data

To back up the data associated with your OpenBazaar account, you'll need to backup the entire datastore directory which is located at ~/.openbazaar2.0/datastore/ on Linux or ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenBazaar2.0/datastore/ on Mac OSX.
