# Identity

OpenBazaar nodes will be able to be identified with hashes (unique identifiers) that are machine readable and not particularly human readable.

It is planned that human readable names mapping to these unique identifers will be implemented in the near future using Blockstack's subdomain system. More details on this system are [here](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/blob/master/docs/subdomains.md). This feature won't be ready for the early versions of OpenBazaar 2.0.
